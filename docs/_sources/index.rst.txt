Welcome to DeepMech's documentation!
====================================

This site aims to provide case studies of finite element analysis, which will be in majority related to civil engineering applications. These examples will be carried out using some open-source features, such as, Code_Aster, Julia and Python. 

This page is under development. If you wish to contact me, please reach out to barcelosenge@gmail.com 

Best Regards, 

Igor BARCELOS.
